it was already shared. _euo_,3

there was this bug with _code_ have you guys had a chance to fix it in master? _euo_,3
so when i build from source - does the build also discover mkl automatically and link against it unconditionally? _euo_,3
does this happen when building libnd4j or nd4j? _euo_,3
could these be relevant for the differing model evaluations (i am ignoring training for now). _euo_,3
change the keras network or dl4j network after import? _euo_,3

I will create an issue _euo_,3

ye but you might prefer it if i report it somewhere so you can organize your to-do-list or whatever _euo_,3

yes..i have two folders. _euo_,3
i like how is formatting :d _euo_,3
_url_ _euo_,3
so ...i will changed to ? _euo_,3
could this change my results ? _euo_,3
i do not know what to follow. _euo_,3
to spend time to check if the latest version of dl4j has the native libraries fixed for linux or to keep my _version_ version and investigate the part with java.library.path _euo_,3
we have tried dl4j with word embedding (word2vec). _euo_,3
we found quite convenient to put the original words as metadata in the input dataset. _euo_,3
i hope this is what metadata are for. _euo_,3
"if so, it would be good to patch the basedatafetcher with the missing _code_ . _euo_",3
"also, it would be good to have metadata in the dl4j samples. _euo_",3
"thanks for the good work, dl4j people! _euo_",3
done : _issue_ _euo_,3
"I have not been able to dig into the original code to spot the issue, if there is any, but well, this is just to let you know in case you hear about that later on... _euo_",3
"anyway, plz do not loose time for now about that, it is probably just my fault :-) and thanks for these examples ! _euo_",3
I have made a gist with my proposed modifications: _url_ . _euo_,3
is it possible it got missed? _euo_,3
"recently i tried word2vec from dl4j, but i found some bugs! _euo_",3
"and i also do the experiment, it is really not correct. _euo_",3
"anyway, i think spark in-built word2vec (scala) is also not good. _euo_",3
because it just use sum of local lookup_table to get global lookup_table directly. _euo_,3
i think it should use mean or some other ways. _euo_,3
so that is why i study these different version of word2vec. _euo_,3
it looks like a bug _euo_,3
_issue_ _euo_,3
I am not 100% sure if it crashes with oracle jdk as well. _euo_,3
i can try oracle locally and let you know in a few hours (takes quite a while which is why i wanted to parallelize). _euo_,3
the other big difference in that environment vs. _euo_,3
my laptop is # of cores. _euo_,3
