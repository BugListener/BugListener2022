_version_ learning rate:_url_. _euo_,3
_version_ learning rate:_url_ i was looking into the rnn regression example and i am a little confused by one of the results i got. _euo_,3
the model reports on the mse of the test dataset. _euo_,3
"this just does not seem right to me, can anyone explain it? _euo_",3
"i just thought a lower mse meant a better fit of the data, and i do not understand why that is not true. _euo_",3
t are the mse when the model is evaluated on the test data. _euo_,3
i believe that these mse numbers should directly correlate to performance on the test dataset. _euo_,3
but t are same trend. _euo_,3
"yes t are collected on the scaled output, _euo_",3
could that be causing the issue? _euo_,3
"okay, any idea why the mse is lower with a worse result? _euo_",3
want me to report it? _euo_,3
also what do you mean by verify with the gui? _euo_,3
sounds good with me. _euo_,3
i will file it. _euo_,3
"its not the biggest issue or bug in the world, but i though i would mension it. _euo_",3
what should i do to solve it? _euo_,3
"ok , i will do _euo_",3
"okay, because it throws exceptions. _euo_",3
for that to work we had to override the _code_ as it did not retain the metadatas. _euo_,3
"yes its not i have been trying to firgure out what is wrong, it works on android device . _euo_",3
what do u get in the server log? _euo_,3
for ios i did not come up with anything other than handling multiple machines devices myself or paying for a solution like saucelabs. _euo_,3
has anyone solved this in another way and can share how you are doing it? _euo_,3
"this looks good, but it seems to solve the issue of running the same tests across multiple different devices. _euo_",3
"btw, does this look reasonable to you guys? _euo_",3
thanks for your inputs! _euo_,3
did the parallel framework work with ios 10 ? _euo_,3
"all these problems lead me to think that appium is not meant to support it, even through i have read various places that one can do it anyway. _euo_",3
is not -u the same as --udid ? _euo_,3
how do i know what to tell appium? _euo_,3
or does the parameter set the udid in the emulator as well? _euo_,3
not sure what that appium ib is so i will check that out. _euo_,3
"maybe i could just put the udid inside my ""default-capabilities.json"" file? _euo_",3
i just do not know what/who decides what the udid of the emulator will be. _euo_,3
if it is appium then maybe it will work. _euo_,3
so maybe it is set when i create the avd then _euo_,3
okay i will try :d _euo_,3
"thank you, hardik! _euo_",3
i will be right back. _euo_,3
need to switch from windows to macos where i do the development/testing. _euo_,3
i do not think it worked out the way i expected. _euo_,3
i do not know but maybe this is a problem for appium? _euo_,3
i have an idea. _euo_,3
someone know what is it? _euo_,3
set the console port number for this emulator instance to <port>. _euo_,3
"the console port number must be an even integer between 554 and 5584, inclusive. _euo_",3
"<port>+1 must also be free and will be reserved for adb."" that may make the udid consistent at least. _euo_",3
"in the end, i decided to create an issue on github: _issue_ _euo_",3
is anyone else facing this issue: _issue_ . _euo_,3
is this the expected behaviour? _euo_,3
i only call 'launch' once in my appium client _euo_,3
does anyone knows a solution for the too many instances of this service are already running error. _euo_,3
or nobody here is using appium _version_+ because it is actually unusable _euo_,3
with all the bugs and things not working _euo_,3
anyone updated to the new itunes? _euo_,3
i have a suspicion its broke appium  ability to talk to safari on real devices _euo_,3
"i haven't, its knocking on the door _euo_",3
is this all on the same machine? _euo_,3
econnrefused suggests something could not reach something else on the network . _euo_,3
do we have to do any configuration in appium? _euo_,3
apart from selecting the folder of apk and device name etc. ? _euo_,3
but i will add those capabilities from you as well and try. _euo_,3
what is the purpose of this line ? _euo_,3
please check the server log for more details. _euo_,3
"and i read what in _version_ this bug will be fixed, but now in some tests i have the same problem can you say me what i do wrong? _euo_",3
is this a known bug by any chance? _euo_,3
thanks for the reply. _euo_,3
so the thinking is something like below should work _code_? _euo_,3
"however, I would like to move from a-->n without releasing finger _euo_",3
in case you did not see my original post (see below). _euo_,3
thanks  I will report a bug as looks like this is not working _euo_,3
"all, please help me.. _euo_",3
i m very new to appium. _euo_,3
i tried this link .. _euo_,3
does somebody know if this issue _issue_ got actually fixed on version _version_? _euo_,3
"a comment there says that the fix was going to be applied on next version, which by the time of the comment should be _version_, but I am still experiencing the same issue on the latest version _euo_",3
i know this is probably bad practice but i wanted to post an issue here . _euo_,3
"the reason is because i do not know if it is in uiautomator2, appium, or android iteself, either way it is a pretty bad bug imho. _euo_",3
"however, it also could be a ""do this"" _issue_. _euo_",3
i will start writing up the bug if no one feels it rings a bell. _euo_,3
"however, i wanted to make sure as it seems like it is a pretty large issue for anyone working with touch targets or coordinate extraction. _euo_",3
i think it implementation fires this bug _issue_ _euo_,3
