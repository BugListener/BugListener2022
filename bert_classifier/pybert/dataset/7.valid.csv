I have encountered a weird bug when using atoptional() and observables. _euo_,0
I have made a plunkr here: _url_ the request fails and the console prints an error 'observable_1 is not defined'. _euo_,0

why did the documentation left out the whole unsubscribing from route params subscription from the docs. _euo_,3
we do not need to subscribe or unsubscribe. _euo_,3
"it is much simpler to write and read:_?"" _euo_",3
these lead one to believe that subscription should be done. _euo_,3
"i appreciate your response, but i feel you did not really read what i asked. _euo_",3
"why does the documentation include expressions like ""the asyncpipe, which will handle unsubscribing from the observable for us"" and ""a snapshot alternative that gives us the initial value of the route parameters. _euo_",3
"we do not need to subscribe or unsubscribe."" _euo_",3
if unsubscription it not needed anyway? _euo_,3
"why refer that snapshot alternative and async pipe make it unnecessary to unsubscribe, if that what it already happens anyway _euo_",3
"maybe i was not clear before, sorry . _euo_",3
i know you do not right docs. _euo_,3
but i was hoping you were able to help out understanding angular's features. _euo_,3
"i know that you do not unsubscribe snapshot, that is pretty easy to understand. _euo_",3
"my point is, why the emphasis on the wonders of using methods that allows to skip unsubscribing, if that already happens? _euo_",3
and I am just going to assume that that emphasis should not be there and that it is a bit misleading. _euo_,3
"and ""we do not need to subscribe or unsubscribe"", could be changed to just ""we do not need to subscribe"" _euo_",3
"but i was told here that router params unsubscribe is done anyway on component destruction, without any need to do it explicitly using the ondestroy hook. _euo_",3
that is new for me . _euo_,3
"i was told that here, after i asked why the recommendation to unsubscribe using the ondestroy hook was removed from the docs. _euo_",3
but i still feel a bit confused from the things i just asked a couple of minutes ago. _euo_,3
I will just focus more on the docs repo for things like these _euo_,3
"in case you are interested, regarding the whole router params unsubscribing thing from yesterday, i finally got clarification here: _url_ summarizing: ""i see your point. _euo_",3
not having to unsubscribe was a virtue of snapshot. _euo_,3
now it isn't. _euo_,3
not having to subscribe remains a snapshot virtue. _euo_,3
I will update prose accordingly. _euo_,3
are there any known issues with ngif rendering on ie? _euo_,3

_url_ am i doing something wrong here or is this a bug . _euo_,3
thanks thats exactly what i was referring to _euo_,3
would you mind linking the pr? _euo_,3
therefore it wont be in till the next major version . _euo_,3
i do not know but angular still dosn't support it . _euo_,3
same issue was here though _url_ which you can still see here _url_. _euo_,3
"i still not sure whether its a bug or i just doing something wrong, maybe ngmodel is requirement when you want ngcontrol to work properly . _euo_",3
is there anyone here who is used ssr in production? _euo_,3
"is this a bug, or do you know a workaround for the following problem? _euo_",3
imagine you have the following webcomponent: _code_. _euo_,3
the component reads the text inside the script tag and sends it to a server which evaluates the result. _euo_,3
the webcomponent should be embedded in an angular app. _euo_,3
it is no angular component and should just rendered as is. _euo_,3
"it has contain a script tag, because 'text/plain' allows it not to be parsed as html and like this it is possible for expressions to contain characters like < as in var1 < var2 without being recognized as the beginning of a html tag. _euo_",3
"i read, that this is because you should not mix javascript with angular templates, but this is just plain text. _euo_",3
is there a workaround. _euo_,3
is it a bug? _euo_,3
I have a really weird scrolling bug. _euo_,3
"until you switch to another page.. what could be the problem, and how can i investigate it? _euo_",3
thanks will try that! _euo_,3
how would i actually set breakpoints on scroll events? _euo_,3
"cannot it just make a list of function calls or something, instead of pause? _euo_",3
because this is really frustrated to debug . _euo_,3
add logging  breakpoints to anywhere your code could possibly touch scroll or height of the element in question and look at the logs to narrow down the area of code its happening in. _euo_,3
"ye exactly,it could be the theme, _euo_",3
cannot i add an event listener to check if for exmaple window. _euo_,3
"okay cool so i do see the ""up"" is triggered, and i have the event data. _euo_",3
now i need to find where it get the call from this shoudl be available in the event data? _euo_,3

i filed a bug today but i want to make sure with you that it really is a bug and not my error: _issue_. _euo_,3
can anyone tell me if I am flushing my request wrong here: _code_. _euo_,3
"i think it might be a problem with the way I am flushing my  requests, maybe I am not cleaning up properly and leaving some requests ""hanging"". _euo_",3
"every service test i write using the same general pattern ( _code_ ) is exhibiting this same buggy behavior, so maybe it is me. _euo_",3
is there a reason for this or is it a bug? _euo_,3
", ran into an interesting bug, and i am not sure this is just my problem, or ng-bootstrap problem, or a best practices problem, or some combination. _euo_",3
so the question is: should we have known better than to use dropdown as a name? _euo_,3
it took me an embarrassingly long time to figure that out. _euo_,3
"i open to theories, but that is definitely the issue. _euo_",3
"note that i use dropdown inside the ngbdropdowntoggle element, and that is where the clash happens, i think. _euo_",3
so is this an angular bug? _euo_,3
"if so, i ike to report it properly, but i do not  know what a good minimal example would be. _euo_",3
