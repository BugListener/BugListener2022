generics is a good idea ? _euo_,3
I will give that a try for my actual use case. _euo_,3

I will test out that theory. _euo_,3
generics is a good idea _? _euo_,3
it is stranger than that: apparently type intersection is not commutative. _euo_,3

effects can include apparent search failures e.g. _euo_,3
as shown at _issue_ _euo_,3
"_url_ if firefox behaviour is proper (andglancingat the shot of google chrome in _issue_ , iassumethat itisproper), then maybe someone will have the rather thankless task of tooth-combing for areas where caching should/must be disallowed. _euo_",3
and on that potentially depressing note (sorry!) _euo_,3
"that example of anapparent search failure is in fact, on very close inspection, a mismatch between the _url_/lobbyand the room/lumina_?both the title bar and the tab are strong indications that the writer is in one room when in fact, the writing is elsewhere. _euo_",3
"and when in the lobby at an?at=_url_, both the title bar and the tab are diminished to a generic 'gitter'; a more distinctive title e.g. _euo_",3

recommendations and to ask about a potential bug: it'd be great for there to be a way to upload an image when you are in fullscreen mode on mac. _euo_,3
"right now, you have to exit fullscreen mode to drag-and-drop. _euo_",3
there should be a photo icon or something above the markdown symbol on the right of the text entry that opens a file selection dialog. _euo_,3
also: it'd be great if images opened in a lightbox instead of in a browser. _euo_,3
why direct the user out of the app to look at content shared within the app? _euo_,3
you do not do it for issues. _euo_,3
is there a way to fix that myself or is that an issue with the integration on gitter's end? _euo_,3
it only lists one integration _euo_,3
i have gitter under services as well _euo_,3
where should i report that issue? _euo_,3
"i analyzed already what is wrong in the irc message, it is a protocol implementation bug _euo_",3
i cannot find any setting that could fix that. _euo_,3
"is there anything like it or it is a known bug (if yes, anyone knows the issue that is tracking this bug)? _euo_",3
wow...this is a 3 years old issue...so i guess it is going to take a long time. _euo_,3
thanks for quick anwsers. _euo_,3

i do not see any network errors. _euo_,3
k. i will copy everything as har when it occurs again but cannot guarantee on shorter log :p. enabled timestamps. _euo_,3

or should i just open an issue :/ _euo_,3

it takes some time to do it manually :s ) _euo_,3

"i think, i have something important to say. _euo_",3
"until there, i will be using docker on a virtual machine, because i cant trust this software anymore. _euo_",3
"but an exec id is not an image, container or task. _euo_",3
"so docker inspect, as far as i can tell, does not support quering exec ids _euo_",3
"i think you are correct, inspect is mostly for containers and images _euo_",3
"hm, I am having an odd issue. _euo_",3
d: it is not the host ip _euo_,3
are you doing the linking at runtime via docker run --link ? _euo_,3
might be worth posting your full command and any dockerfile/docker-composer.yml etc. _euo_,3
