it does work when i set the encapsulation to shadowdom (but then the icon font does not load). _eou_,0
why does encapsulating a reactive form adjustment in a _code_ resolve the _code_ problem mentioned here _issue_? _eou_,0
"that triggers the expression changed error, unless of course it is wrapped in _code_. _eou_",0
"now facing issue with ssr, it is giving error _code_. _eou_",0
this error is from third party library. _eou_,0
"according to update.angular.io, _code_ is supposed to migrate my tsconfig.json to a tsconfig.base.json, but that did not happen.why is that? _eou_",0
"when the library is in the same project ie there is an src/app directory and a projects/my_library, app_initializer factory function runs. _eou_",0
"if i then build the library and use npm link on the dist directory, and consume that again using npm link in a completely different angular workspace then the app_initializer factory function will not run. _eou_",0
everything is working fine even when i create a build for android. _eou_,0
"but when created a build for ios, build is successful and app runs on the emulator but ng2-cookies does not work in ios. _eou_",0
"the set cookie method executes without any error, but get cookie method of the library returns an empty object. _eou_",0
"just to follow-up on that unable to communicate with gitter message that i mentioned the other day, it only happens in this channel I have noticed. _eou_",0
_url_ I am seeing a lot of this lately. _eou_,0
seems like it might be this:_code_. _eou_,0
"I am on a very stable connection, and as i said, this happens on two different machines at two different locations that have different isps. _eou_",0
"in chromium, gitter does not scroll down to last message automatically. _eou_",0
i have to press page-down button to see the latest one. _eou_,0
"though it happens sometimes, not consistently. _eou_",0
i do not appear to be getting notifications for pms on my iphone despite my notification settings being set to all. _eou_,0
"oddly enough i was getting vibrations & sounds that i did not know where t were coming from cause i did not get any banners, but from the looks of it it was from gitter. _eou_",0
as in it sent my phone sounds and badges but not banners. _eou_,0
"try one more, i was in the app and did not hear anything (might be worth a separate issue, in-app notifications. _eou_",0
"I am actually seeing a different issue at this very moment, I am not seeing the messages I have sent just now _eou_",0
ye still missing them unfortunately. _eou_,0
i am not seeing anything from recent months. _eou_,0
for example this search _code_ returns posts from may 6th. _eou_,0
"when i click on hide chat, nothing happens, and t are still in my sidebar on the left. _eou_",0
"nevermind, it just took a couple minutes to kick in for some reason. _eou_",0
seems to have worked though _eou_,0
I have started seeing 502 errors from ws.gitter.im/faye about an hour ago in my app _eou_,0
actually looks like the 502 started on november 21st already. _eou_,0
so something else happened today that impacts my gitter streaming api connection _eou_,0
i saw it in a graph in our logging but i must've done something wrong since it shows them going further back now. _eou_,0
"and in fact t look expected since each of them has a request duration of exactly 120seconds, which i think is part of the streaming api. _eou_",0
when i click a notification it updates the url but the page does not update _eou_,0
gitter throws _code_. _eou_,0
"after this, it throws itself into a loading loop and will not load anymore. _eou_",0
removing cookies related to gitter.im clears the problem. _eou_,0
"only add-on is ublock (to be specific, tested on two instances of firefox, one with only ublock and one with quite a few more extensions) _eou_",0
i have a problem where the last unread message is never marked as read in a chatroom after i enabled threaded conversations. _eou_,0
"if i reply, my notification goes away, but all my chat partners get one instead until t write something. _eou_",0
"i tried turning off threaded conversations, but the notifications are still there! _eou_",0
"for the meantime, i turned off threads, and then turned notifications for the affected channels off and on again, which removed the problem (but also threads) for now. _eou_",0
"on chrome (latest) -> create button on the home page, signin via github (i have an existing gitter account linked) -> the steps to create + invite people, but clicking the final create, i end up with a _code_ issue. _eou_",0
but i could not because the gitter lack of btn to do so. _eou_,0
"but every time i launch it, it asks for permission to access my account, and when i click ""allow"", i get a 404 error. _eou_",0
"I am able to use the web gitter client, and the desktop macos client. _eou_",0
the 404 is for a url that start _url_. _eou_,0
"cannot scroll down to see the full msg(it's not always, and when i change from one chat to another it gets fixed). _eou_",0
"like i said changing from one chatroom to another fixes the problem, refreshing the window does not ok _eou_",0
i just upgraded to ios 13 and the gitter app scrolling is not behaving correctly. _eou_,0
briefly it doesn’t scroll to the bottom so i can’t see newest posts. _eou_,0
it seems to just jump to random point in history. _eou_,0
it’s a bit better in safari but gitter app isn’t usable at the moment. _eou_,0
"when manually scrolling down to the end, it just jumps back. _eou_",0
my avatar did not update. _eou_,0
i am signed in with my gitlab and changed the avatar to a pic a while ago and it did not update yet. _eou_,0
i am finding that the windows one does not open on the last read message whereas macos does e.g.  i am a member of _url_ and on windows it always starts on 13th july. _eou_,0
private tab was ok (but of course i was not logged in). _eou_,0
so i tried logging out and back in again in a 'normal' tab and that seems to have fixed it. _eou_,0
odd because when i deleted all cookies i also had to log in again but that did not fix it. _eou_,0
if i close the main window there does not appear to be a way to restore it. _eou_,0
the notification area icon has sign out and exit options only. _eou_,0
if i click the launcher again nothing appears to happen. _eou_,0
i cannot add integrations today into any rooms. _eou_,0
"when i try, i get a pop up message ""gitter. _eou_",0
i tried in both chrome and firefox but no luck. _eou_,0
the issue is : when i switched to the room - comments frame randomly and fast scrolls up and down for a while (1 -2 sec) then stops. _eou_,0
I have tried to clear cache for gitter but this did not helps. _eou_,0
here is an image _url_ this happens on every room switch. _eou_,0
"sometimes pretty fast, possible with only 3 steps. _eou_",0
sometimes too long - with 5 or even more scroll steps. _eou_,0
"and getting “validation failed” but i don’t understand what’s failing or why, or what i can do about it. _eou_",0
_url_ looks like maybe the issue was i had had a space in the room name. _eou_,0
i reloaded the page and tried again and was able to create the room. _eou_,0
"when i ssh into the box and issue a stop or background command using ‘ctrl-c’ or ‘ctrl-z’, the remote process is not responding. _eou_",0
after running docker-compose up - ctrl-z just shows: ^z^z^z^z^z^z. _eou_,0
the services themselves are running correctly. _eou_,0
"but I am getting some errors, like: _code_. _eou_",0
"some of the containers stop, but most do not (e.g. _eou_",0
out of 12 services only 3 are stopped) . _eou_,0
docker-desktop seems to be hanging and the only thing i can do is restart it. _eou_,0
this used to work fine prior to v2. _eou_,0
"i have an odd situation where /tmp in my container usually has 77 perms, but sometimes gets 755 perms, which causes springboot to fail. _eou_",0
.i have an issue: I am receiving port is already allocated _eou_,0
this issue persists after i do docker-compose down. _eou_,0
and it is not happening every time. _eou_,0
also it does not reproduce constantly. _eou_,0
disable that still having the error. _eou_,0
"I have been struggling with cache invalidation - specifically, when running a docker-in-docker docker build, it never seems to use the build cache. _eou_",0

hi  i am facing with strange scroll issue when switching between rooms. _eou_,3
as i can see there is no any opened issue about this and i am going to think that this is something specific to my browser. _eou_,3
"sorry, i don;t know how to explain correctly. _eou_",3
step - i mean one up or down scroll. _eou_,3
i think I have found. _eou_,3
the mater was in browser tab. _eou_,3
in new tab there is no such issue. _eou_,3
"so, i think something accumulates during tab lifecycle. _eou_",3
maybe some memory leaks or something similar - i'am not a big spec at this _eou_,3
