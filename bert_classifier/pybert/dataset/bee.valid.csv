dcr - need swt.vertical style for coolbar,1
i wanted to use coolbar/coolitem for the intro launch bar so that i can get the os-specific handle rendering but i need to be able to position coolbar vertically when in the left and right window trim areas.,1
mark occurrences should work for one position past reference,1
one space after the occurrence should be considered as well.,1
[accessibility] text should read its read_only state,1
"when a user enters a text field, it should indicate whether it is read-only or not.",1
"when the text is read-only it should say, ""read-only text <<and start reading the text value>>"".",1
expected result:no exception.,1

jobs should be canceled by the plugin that scheduled them during shutdown:,1
the global definition of a javadoc attachment for a jre in the preferences window sholud imho be used as a default value if there are no specific attachments defined.,1
it annotates itself - rather than something outgoing from the declare statement,1
and something incoming on the simple type.,1
[viewmgmt] (regression) typing space should activate view menu button,1
it should drop down the view menu.,1
"for consistency, and to do the expected thing when used with a screen reader, we should allow space key to work here.",1
it seems logical to me to have this behaviour linked to this preference.,1
expected result:it works without any problem.,1
"there should minimally be a busy indicator, and ideally move into a modal context thread to avoid freezing the ui for long periods.",1
if a few does not specify a icon it should not get one for free.,1
[content assist] for static members in unresolved qualifying type should show deprecated type,1
proposals that import a type as side effect should also be rendered as deprecated if the type to import is deprecated (not only if the member itself is deprecated).,1
we need a way to specify (perhaps in the editor extension point) that the editor is not suitable for viewing remote files.,1
alternatively the editor manager could silently use a text editor if the bpel edior failed.,1
"to avoid blocking the ui thread, logging should occur in a background job.",1
"regardless of how you do it, i think there needs to be a way to avoid generating these warnings (other than filtering them out).",1
"if it involves work for the extender, it should be documented in the schema documentation.",1
i suggest that publishoperation2 should not break because of such a simple problem.,1
instead it could easily perform a refrestlocal before publishing the files.,1
show version in different font in bundle list,1
esc is not normally used to clear a field.,1
esc within a dialog should dismiss it.,1
"suggest not intercepting esc, and just allowing backspace to clear the field",1
(it's selected by default anyway).,1
nb it might be wise to kill the spawned eclipse rather than close it or else your test workspace attempts to (de)serialize all the errors which does not do it any favours.,1
"[junit] upon ""unknown source"" in a stacktrace,  a double-click should open the properties-java build path - libraries [junit]",1
"however, it would be great if upon a double click there, the projectproperties-java build path-libraries would open the concerned library where icould attach the source.",1
this would be especially useful if the .class file is present in multiple .jarfiles because it then would bring to the one implementation that gets really used.,1
[change sets] should show activity affordance,1
carat location should be updated when user types in console.,1
the carat location should be updated whenever a user enters text in a console.,1
expected results:eclipse should start normally.,1
"stay there for about 3 secs or so, then mouse over some text in the java file where you would expect hover help.",1
report parameter dialog should not appear for default value has been set.,1
"more information:getcolor() should be called in paint, as it is done in super-class org.eclipse.draw2d.lineborder.",1
tabfolder should not use ptcalccanvas in getclientarea,1
99.1% of the users expecting the focus on the control itself and not the handle button.,1
the users expecting to press key up/down or alt+down to select an item.,1
expected behavior:			- page break inside avoid works properly,1
i think it should be controllable for all charts as long as x-axis is either linear (numbers) or dates.,1
it would be better if the icon was cleared when the project was closed.,1
java should have got a problem due to disallowedlocation for use of annotation atann.,1
expected result:report can show in web viewer/html/pdf,1
[jface] error dialog should be resizable and not print redundant messages,1
the error dialog that appears on synchronization errors should be resizable (as every dialog with dynamic content).,1
"furthermore, the 2-row message should be shortened.",1
< expected: there are exactly two proposals: 'extends' and 'super',1
sort by parent path should take method name into account,1
- i believe the secondary sort consideration should be the method name,1
- this would make the results sorted alphabetically,1
"on the other hand, eclipse",1
"2.1.2 accepted ""\t"" (or it worked ok if i just pressed tabulation) and \n in this dialog.",1
it seems to me that this editor should recognize plug-ins in my development workspace along with the plug-ins in my eclipse install plugins dir.,1
the reload button should probably be pushed down next to the table viewer.,1
3. progress monitor is needed when parsing/reloading features from a new location,1
the icon for java-search-participant hits in the export-package and import-,1
"package manifest headers should be indicated with a package icon, not a class icon.",1
"for example, the following program should print ""199"" 40 times(once from each thread).",1
"this should say something like ""deleting resources..."",",1
"""deleting project..."" or similar.",1
it should be input.getcentroid().,1
clarify some of the messages in preconditions.checkargument,1
shutdown command without username and password should work with mixed client and network server releases.,1
the new shutdown command introduced by derby-2109 will work obviosuly only on client and server with derby-2109 changes.,1
for client/server not with derby-2109 changes attempting to user use name and password will get an error.,1
it should probably have raised the same exception as the first query.,1
"and if not, the result should only have had one column.",1
restriction.doublequote() should use idutil.normaltodelimited() to get proper quoting of the names.,1
"the row (french_roast,5) should not be there since it is not a result of the first query.",1
tests should restore the timeout values to default after t are done running.,1
derby should support the standard rules.,1
we should try to find a way to make the scalability the same regardless of whether or not the threads share the same plan.,1
make grantrevoketest pass in non-english locale,1
it would be good to clean up all the connections in teardown().,1

"although 1.5 is still beta, we would want to submit a bug to sun if ourimplementation techniques are valid, so we do not have to change thosetechniques.",3
"for 1.2, we should at document if we do not fix, since many peopleare using 1.5.",3
style and alt-style attributes can be comma separated styles.,3
this support was added to handled nl fragments that needed custom css for bi-di languages.,3
"if a list of styles was specified in a configextension (as opposed to a single style), the style fails to resolve.",3

"propertystoreconverter.convertproperties visits every resource in the workspaceand creates a property converter, even though property stores are only found onworkspace root and projects.",3
"also, the propertystoreconverter class should not even be created in the casewhere we are already using the new property store.",3
i will optimize these cases.,3

[editormgmt] cvs repositories view opens remote files with registered editor,3
since 3.1 the cvs repositories view has used the associated editor when viewing files in the repository.,3

bug in reflection delegate signature for array of object type,3
the following problem is interesting because the advice weaves correctly with java 1.5 ltw and also using java 1.4 with build-time weaving.,3
"pointcut:    private pointcut inexecquery() :         (within(uk.ltd.getead.dwr.impl.executequery) || within(uk.ltd.getead.dwr.executequery));        public pointcut dwrquery(method method, object receiver, object[] params) :         inexecquery() && withincode(* execute(.",3
&&         call(* method.invoke(.,3
"&& args(receiver, params) && target(method);",3
"protected pointcut monitorend() : dwrquery(*, *, *);",3
I have tracked it down to failing to find the method in resolvedtype.matches.,3
"""m1.getsignature()""= ""(ljava/lang/object;[ljava.lang.object;)ljava/lang/object;""	""m2.getsignature()""= ""(ljava/lang/object;[ljava/lang/object;)ljava/lang/object;""",3
it looks to me like the signature for array types in the reflection delegate is erroneously using .,3

i have launch shortcuts that use the new xml expression language.,3
"I am assuming the schema for the xml expression language is fairly large, and this is why you did not include it.",3
i'am running eclipse 3.02 with cdt 2.1.1 in scientfic linux 3.0.2 == redhat,3
server 3.0.2 with java 1.4.2_08 from sun.,3
i work with a larger standard c make project checked out from cvs.,3
now for the second time the following happened to me:,3
- when running my program it terminated on some error (my problem),3
- on the second time i tried to use the team/share option.,3
eclipse then noticed that there were cvd directories and reconnected everything up again.,3
this seems to be the workaround.,3
this is confusing and should be fixed.,3
i never experienced a thing like this when developing java programs though i do pretty bad things sometimes.,3
the virtual folder is an output folder of a project.,3
the publish operation then generates some files in the output folder.,3
the publish operation is contributed via the publishtask extension point and its priority is configured so that it runs before other publish operations.,3
i tracked it down (using a coreexception breakpoint) to publishoperation2#execute (line 53).,3
there is also another thing i do not understand.,3
I am using a flex project and configured a virtual deployment folder in it that maps to a project location.,3
the tomcat server is also configured to run the projects right out of the workspace.,3
the bundles list on the artifact deploy page uses the same font for the bundle and the version.,3
representing the version number in a different font/color/style would help split the two apart.,3
"for example, one could put the version number italicised in a dark green colour to help it stand out.",3
this can be very bad for non-local file systems.,3
-> next breakpoint is hit and we get prompted.,3
public class ptest { public static void main(string[] args) { hitbp1();,3
} private static void hitbp2() {,3
"system.out.println(""bp2""); //breakpoint here",3
} private static void hitbp1() {,3
"system.out.println(""bp1""); //breakpoint here",3

there is a mistake in the code that checks for the serializable interface,3

[import/export] importing existing projects from zip does not work,3
i am trying to get some existing projects into my workspace.,3

you can control thin in scatter plot but by some reason can not do it in area chart (as well as probably the other types as well).,3
otherwise area charts looks ugly and unprofessional.,3
i can fix the problem myself if someone gives me guidance where to look and what should i do approximately.,3
this bug is for the backport of bug 282364 to the r3_2_maintenance stream.,3
inline policy.localize to enable nls tooling,3
since the only client for the localize method is the plug-in startup code and since this method is not api i suggest to fix this and use the pattern that all other eclipse nls accessor classes use.,3

[progress] [dialogs] poor message during project deletion.,3
my build file relies on jars in ${user.home}/.,3
the normal ant version loads jars from ${user.home}/.,3
soeclipse behaves different from normal ant.,3
i am trying to support dropping of links from internet explorer to the blank editor area (workbenchwindow?),3
"as far as i can tell from examining the eclipse source code, ie wants this operation to be a drop_link.",3
this instantiation occurs in org.eclipse.ui.internal.editorsashcontainer and seems to be preventing us from supporting dropping of links from ie.,3
would it be possible to get support for drop_link?,3
i performed the following scenario:,3
the file is an incoming addition.,3
update from the merge editor results in an error because the incoming file,3
creation does not have a local parent directory.,3
the problem is that the folder,3
appears in the base and remote but not in the local (since it was pruned) so it,3
is interpreted as an outgoing deletion.,3
we need to change the sync kind,3

there is a plugin called rat that automates these checks.,3

the problem is in the reduce method itself: on line 60 ( return input.getcentroid(); ),3

i think we can avoid this specific error by changing lobstoredprocedure (and perhaps other internal procedures)  to  use the code in  systemprocedures.getdefaultconn() which always connects to derby by using = internaldriver.activedriver(),3
this of course will not solve the general problem for any user created procedure or function that performs sql.,3
i am not sure if there is a good solution for that.,3
i asked the jcc driver team to see if there is a way t can determine if t are running inside the db2 process or not.,3
but regardless of these product workarounds i think the basic problem is design flaw in the specification.,3
drivermanager cannot differentiate the url if all database products use the same one for server side jdbc.,3
