exists on the prototype, then there's no copying by definition - the engine walks up the prototype chain to find it. no optimization required, this is how prototype inheritance works. when you do new

an internal .__proto__ property which points to the prototype object and the engine simply follows that whenever a member isn't found directly on the instance", "the prototype is not a \"template\" as the name might suggest - new instances literally point back to the single prototype object", "perfect. thanks! assuming i know the answer here, as the docs say that class () 'creates a new function'.
