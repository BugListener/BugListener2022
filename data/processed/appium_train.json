configs/settings in a file, and then reload that file at a later time to reproduce the exact same network later on. if this is true (and correct me if its not!) then it occurred to me that it would be super helpful if these \"network config files\" had a standard format. that way, i could train a network to learn how to spot a bowling ball in an image using one directory  export the file, and use it down the road in another project that perhaps uses a totally different tech stack. but because both frameworks support this open standard, both would be capable of loading and configuring the exact

inheritance works. when you do new c(), the engine does (among other things) the equivalent of object.create(c.prototype), where c.prototype is itself an object containing the non-static methods. they are not copied, the instance has an internal .__proto__ property which points to the prototype object and the engine simply follows that whenever a member isn't found directly on the instance", "the
